    Breaking Changes:
      * New loading semantics and module system. Removes `load` method which
        evaluated a loaded script into the current environment. Adds `core.load` which
        returns an object. [kevinclark in 9bfa8]

        See [Script.java](hegemon-core/src/main/java/com/cueup/hegemon/Script.java) for more.

      * Loading now throws exceptions on circular dependencies.
      * 'hegemon/json' now a module.
      * Require names for scripts (for better stack traces) [robbywalker in b9f96]
